This project demonstrates the integration of LangChain, Chroma Vector Store, and Gradio to build an interactive conversational AI powered by OpenAI models. It utilizes a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling the system to query a knowledge base and provide insightful answers in a conversational manner.

Features:

Knowledge Base Integration: Load documents from a directory structure to create a searchable knowledge base.

Vector Store: Use Chroma for efficient document chunking and vector embedding storage.

Dimensionality Reduction: Visualize document embeddings in 2D and 3D using t-SNE.

Interactive Chat: Deploy a chatbot interface using Gradio for seamless interactions.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Retrieve contextually relevant chunks from the vector store and generate responses using GPT models.
